## Profile website task

In this assignment I made sure to use as much as possible of all the elements and definitions we had learned in the course .
I really enjoyed the design part , already feel so obsessed with Perfecting the Details! But I guess I am ,because
I have a background in  design and graphics ,so yes I do know what a good design should be!

### some points
* I built a responsive HTML page using flixbox.
* I used Anchore to link the navbar with page's sections.
* Designed in Sass file because Sass boasts more features and abilities than CSS extension language out and its much easier. that we don't  have to write a long and complicated code.
* Animation: as always  do not to use many animations, because I rather to keep it simple, so I used just    "fadein" one.
