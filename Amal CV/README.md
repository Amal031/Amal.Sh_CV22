## Profile website task

In this assignment, I made sure to use as much as possible of all the elements and syntaxes we had learned in the course .
I really enjoyed the design part , already feel so obsessed with the details and perfection! But I guess I am ,because
I have a background in  design and graphics , so I do know what a good design should be!

### some points
* I built a responsive page using flixbox.
* I used Anchore to link the navbar with page's sections.
* Designed in Sass, file because Sass boasts more features and abilities than CSS extension language , that we don't have to write a long and complicated code.
* Animation: as always, I don't use many animations, because I Prefer to keep it simple, so I used just "fadein" animation.
